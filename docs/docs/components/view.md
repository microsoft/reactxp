This component is a generic container for other components.

## Props
In addition to the [common accessibility props](/reactxp/docs/accessibility.html), the following props are supported.

``` javascript
// Alternate text for screen readers.
// If not defined, title prop is used.
accessibilityLabel: string = undefined;

// Traits used to hint screen readers, etc.
accessibilityTraits: AccessibilityTrait | AccessibilityTrait[] = undefined;

// Region for accessibility mechanisms
accessibilityLiveRegion: AccessibilityLiveRegion =
    undefined; // Android and web only

// Expose the element and/or its children as accessible to Screen readers
importantForAccessibility?: ImportantForAccessibility = Auto;

// Animation of children
//   - Every child must have a `key`.
//   - String refs aren't supported on children. Only callback refs are.
animateChildEnter: boolean = false;
animateChildLeave: boolean = false;
animateChildMove: boolean = false;

// Id of an element that describes the view for screenreader.
ariaLabelledBy?: string = undefined; // Web only

// A custom role description to be read by the screen readers.
ariaRoleDescription?: string = undefined; // Web only

// Block touches for this component and all of its children
blockPointerEvents: boolean = false; // iOS and Android only

// Specifies a unique id for an HTML element
id: string = undefined; // Web only

// Ignore clicks and other mouse events, allowing children or
// components behind to receive them
ignorePointerEvents: boolean = false; // web only

// When the keyboard navigation is happening, restrict the focusable
// elements within this view. Useful for popups and modals, you
// might want to prevent the focus from going outside of the popup or
// modal. The views with restrictFocusWithin are stacked and the last
// mounted view is a winner. This means if you, for example, have
// restricted the focus within some modal, and you have a popup (which
// also desires for a restricted focus) inside this modal, the popup
// will get the restriction, but when dismissed, the restriction will
// be restored for the modal. See also the companion method
// setFocusRestricted() below.
// WARNING: For the sake of performance, this property is readonly and
// changing it during the View life cycle will produce an error.
restrictFocusWithin: boolean = false;

// When the keyboard navigation is happening, do not focus on this view
// and on all focusable elements inside this view. See also the companion
// method setFocusLimited() below.
// Useful for the list items, allows to skip the consecutive focusing on
// one list item (and item's internal focusable elements) after another
// using the Tab key and implement the switching between the items using
// the arrow keys (or using some other behaviour).
// When limitFocusWithin=LimitFocusType.Limited, the View and the focusable
// components inside the View get both tabIndex=-1 and aria-hidden=true.
// When limitFocusWithin=LimitFocusType.Accessible, the View and the focusable
// components inside the View get only tabIndex=-1.
// WARNING: For the sake of performance, this property is readonly and
// changing it during the View life cycle will produce an error.
limitFocusWithin: LimitFocusType = LimitFocusType.Unlimited;

// Additional invisible DOM elements will be added inside the view
// to track the size changes that are performed behind our back by
// the browser's layout engine faster (ViewBase checks for the layout
// updates once a second and sometimes it's not fast enough)
importantForLayout: boolean = false; // web only

// Other Events
onLayout: (e: ViewOnLayoutEvent) => void = undefined;

// Rasterize contents using offscreen bitmap (perf optimization)
shouldRasterizeIOS: boolean = false; // iOS only

// Keyboard tab order
tabIndex: number = undefined;

// Text for a tooltip
title: string = undefined;

// See below for supported styles
style: ViewStyleRuleSet | ViewStyleRuleSet[] = [];

// Should use hardware or software rendering?
viewLayerTypeAndroid: 'none' | 'software' | 'hardware'; // Android only property

// Visual touchfeedback properties
// Disable default opacity animation on touch on views that have
// onPress handlers

// Opacity value the button should animate to, on touch on views that
// have onPress handlers

## Methods
``` javascript
// Sets the accessibility focus to the component.
focus(): void;

// The focus does not go outside the view with restrictFocusWithin by default,
// setFocusRestricted() allows to turn this restricton off and back on.
setFocusRestricted(restricted: boolean): void; // web only


// The focus does not go inside the view with limitFocusWithin by default,
// setFocusLimited() allows to turn this limitation off and back on.
setFocusLimited(limited: boolean): void; // web only
```
