## Tips for Web

ReactXP assumes that your main web page will have a DOM element container called "app-container". The root view of the app will be rendered within this container. Typically, this DOM element will be a &lt;div&gt; that covers the entire page.

## Tips for Native

The main module is assumed to be called "RXApp", and it must be registered as such by the native code. Refer to the sample app for how to register the module in Android and iOS.
