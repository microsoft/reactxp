ReactXP provides a [Storage API](/reactxp/docs/apis/storage) for reading and writing simple key/value pairs. Many apps have more complex storage requirements. For this, we developed a no-SQL database wrapper that works on React Native and on browsers. The solution isn't tied to ReactXP, but they work well together.

For more details, refer to the [NoSqlProvider](https://github.com/Microsoft/NoSQLProvider) github site.
