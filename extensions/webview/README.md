# reactxp-webview
This module provides a cross-platform control that allows the display of an independent web page within the [ReactXP](https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/) library. This used to be a part of ReactXP core, but was extracted to be a standalone module inline with React Native `Lean Core` initiative. This exists as a standalone module to prevent users of ReactXP from having to link native modules when getting started.

## Getting Started
This module relies on [react-native-webview](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-webview) and will need to be linked into the react-native project.
This can be done by following the linking instructions in the React Native documentation or by running
```react-native link react-native-webview```

## Documentation
For detailed documentation, look [here](https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/docs/extensions/webview.html).
