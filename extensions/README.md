# ReactXP Extensions
The ReactXP library is designed to be as lightweight as possible, including only those cross-platform APIs and "primitive" components that are required by almost every app. Functionality that is needed less commonly is provided in the form of optional extensions.

There are two distinct types of extensions.
1. Additional APIs or "primitive" components that have separate implementations for each of the supported platforms.
2. Higher-level components that contain no platform-specific code but build upon the lower-level primitives to provide new (typically more complex) functionality.
